            Now to talk about more revolutions that have taken place in <br>
            our world. I'll talk about 3 revolutions that each show one of:

        <ul>
            <li style="color: crimson">Revenge</li>
            <li style="color: lightsteelblue">Radicalism</li>
            <li style="color: mediumspringgreen">Redemption</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Buttons for Radicalism, Redemption, and Revenge !-->
    <div>
        <button type="button" onclick="ShowHide('Radicalism')">Radicalism</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="ShowHide('Redemption')">Redemption</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="ShowHide('Revenge')">Revenge</button>
    </div>


    <div hidden id='Radicalism'>
        <h4> Radicalism </h4>
        <p>
            <br>
            Revolutions as a result of radicalism tend to take a very different form<br>
            than that of those born out of civil unrest. Most of the time it's a slow<br>
            change that takes place in the upper echelons of a country's government.<br>
            An easy example of a revolution of radicalism would be Nazi Germany, showcasing<br>
            how an ideology can take root in a government, bleed to the people, and <br>
            push forward destructive behaviors and the bidding of one man.<br><br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div hidden id="Redemption">
        <h4> Redemption </h4>
        <p>
            <br>
            Redemption is a more difficult motive to pin down for revolution as most<br>
            revolutions have this as a part of the reason. Be it redemption of the <br>
            poor in bringing down the upper class or like with the revenge example a<br>
            group of people reclaiming what was taken from them to return themselves to<br>
            what they had before and feel redeemed.<br>
            <br>

            The Example I will point towards will be most if not all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_American_wars_of_independence" target="_blank">South American wars of independence</a><br>
            as they fought to remove the Spanish occupancy and return independence to th nations<br>
            even though by this point many of the people had spaniard heritage and in some countries<br>
            the indigenous people were treated poorly.<br><br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div hidden id='Revenge'>
        <h4 style="background: darkslateblue;
        color: crimson; border: 1px dashed crimson; " > Revenge </h4>
        <p>
            <br>
            A great example of a revolution based out of revenge is the <br>
            Ako incident in Japan. Also known as the revenge of the 47<br>
            ronin, it is an event in which people enacted revenge on the<br>
            man who usurped power by killing their master. This story could <br>
            also be used to showcase redemption as that's one of the many factors<br>
            which fueled their revenge campaign. <br>
