    There are many things I slowly work on outside of school<br>
    but the most consistent one has been going down rabbit holes<br>
    of coding, much like I did with these webpages, whenever I had<br>
    free time I found myself working on this rather than my usual<br>
    playing video games. Even after turning in this assigment I'll<br>
    still continue to work on it as it can both be used as part of<br>
    my portfolio while simultaneously hosting my portfolio.<br><br>

      The biggest thing I have spent my time on recently is journaling<br>
    its the most consitent thing I do, at least every night but I'm<br>
    beginning to do almost every morning as well. It helps me stay<br>
    productive and positive throughout the day by setting goals for<br>
    myself and doing a loose outline of the day as well as helps me track<br>
    my progress on things such as projects, piano learning, or nearly anything else!<br><br>
