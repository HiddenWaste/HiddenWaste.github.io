    <h2> Fav Movies / TV</h2>
<p>
    <br>
  Movies aren't my main entertainment forte but I do have a <br>
  list of hard favorites. As shown with the images below. <br><br>
</p>

        <br>
        While very different movies these movies/series of <br>
        movies are some of my favorites.<br><br>
    </p>
    <br><br>

        <br>
        Film is a very interesting medium compared to music as it holds<br>
        music itself and a visual aspect which is primary. Soundtracks in <br>
        film have evolved immensely throughout its history, with the first <br>
        films not even having sound! The three movies shown above each have<br>
        interesting uses of sound, the most interesting soundtrack of them
        being Kill Bill's.<br><br>

            In Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino finds a unique way to blend the western<br>
        style of music with the various other aspects of the movie, with a tinge <br>
        of eastern influence during the portions that take place in Japan, and <br>
        full buckled down western when the movie moves towards the heart of America.

    <h4>Visuals in Film</h4>

    <p>
        <br>
        The great ability of film is the combination of both visual and audio mediums.<br>
        This allows for creative capabilities unlike any other medium since it contains<br>
        both combined. In film many have masterfully done this combination to create very<br>
        desired emotions or aesthetics as well as entire fictional worlds with immense depth.<br>
